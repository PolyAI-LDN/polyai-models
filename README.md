After much consideration, the [PolyAI](https://www.polyai.com/) team has decided to take down the ConveRT models from the public domain.

Over the course of last year, we have been very excited to see ConveRT gaining a huge amount of traction in various communities - that was something we didn't expect when we first released it. However, with the amount of business growing and the shift of our team's priorities, we no longer have the resources to responsibly maintain or provide support for these models.

PolyAI is working to create end-to-end voice assistants. If you're interested in helping us, check out our careers page at [polyai.com/careers](https://www.polyai.com/careers).
